          While at Broadspecturm, I worked as a full-stack engineer at{" "}
          <CustomLink href="http://kurz.ai/">Kurz.ai</CustomLink> where I helped
          build a scalable and progressive web application for learning
          practical CNC programming for the KELLER Group in Germany.

          Prior to joining Broaspectrum, I worked as the software lead for the
          MEST Express startup Moreplex Company Ltd, where I helped architect
          the company's software architectures for its growing eSkills and
          eCommerce platforms. I also led the team to build an AI product
          recommender system. And more recently is the yet-to-be-launched AI
          assistant dermatologist.
